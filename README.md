There are several attempts to bring C11 like `<threads.h>` support to systems
which are not supporting it, however most of them are either incomplete or not
strictly standard conforming or not meant to be used on non-POSIX systems.

This library tries to be as thin and light as possible, while solving the above
problem. It is also regularly tested on Arch Linux (always the latest version of
it), Mac OS X (El Capitan) and Windows 10.
